# Rock-Paper-Scissor

This is my very first project created using JavaScript. I learned about using conditional statements such as if and else statements to build a simple rock paper scissor game. The project was completed as part of The Odin Project, an open-source curriculum that teaches web development.

In this game, the player can choose between rock, paper, or scissors and compete against the computer. The winner is determined based on the traditional rules of rock paper scissors.

I had a lot of fun working on this project and it was a great way to start learning JavaScript. Feel free to check out the code and give it a try!
